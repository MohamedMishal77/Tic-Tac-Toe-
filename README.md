# Tic-Tac-Toe-
Tic Tac Toe game using python by implementing the concepts of functions.
- The game satisfies the following Test Cases :</br>
                       1. Player **X** Wins</br>
                       2. Player **O** Wins</br>
                       3. The Game Ends in a **Draw**
- The game also provides an option for the players to **terminate/quit** the game midway.
- The game has several user defined functions which are used to make the game logic work properly as intended.
- Moreover , the development process helped me gain a clear understanding about functions.
